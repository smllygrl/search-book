# Google Books API Search Engine

This was the fourth challenge given to us at _nology.

We were to build a search engine which renders 10 books (with an author, title, image and description) upon a user query.

This was our first experience rendering items from non static sources.

The main learnings I have had during this project are --
+ Taking in user queries and rendering results
+ The concept of an API
+ Reading and using "the documentation"
+ More JavaScript comptency

Items to be refined in my Search Engine --
+ The styling of the items being rendered
+ A function to take in multi-word queries to be searched, rather than asking the use to type+like+this
